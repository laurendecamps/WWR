        <h2>Lauren DeCamps</h2>
        <p>Hi everyone! I am currently pursuing my degree in software development and am so excited. I have always loved creating and originally started school as a graphic design major. I am currently married and have been for a little over two years. I currently run an Etsy shop and do some graphic design work on the side.</p>
        <p>The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is the religion classes. I have been a member all my life and I feel like having those classes keeps me in tune with the spirit and helps motivate me towards getting my degree. I recently got a certificate in UX Design and wanted to understand the coding side of things and I felt like this would be a good way to go.</p>
